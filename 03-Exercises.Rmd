# Exam Exercises

## Mock exam 1

### Exercise 1
Let $$\Omega:=(0,\infty)^2.$$
Calculate the solution to the following Cauchy-Problem,
\begin{align*}
  &x_1\partial_1u(x) + x_2\partial_2u(x) + x_1x_2u(x) = 0, \quad x \in \Omega; \\
  &u(q,q^2) = 5, \quad q > 0.
\end{align*}
\textbf{Solution}

As the exercise does not ask if the problem is non-characteristic, we suppose that it is.
The first step is to bring the problem to normal form.
